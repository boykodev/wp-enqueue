# wp-enqueue
This plugin makes it dramatically easier to enqueue scripts and styles. Manage it from a separate option menu page.

You can enqueue in head or in footer, enqueue in admin dashboard, enqueue only for homepage, enqueue for all pages/posts/categories/archives or enqueue for a specific page/post/category.

Choose from any script/style in theme folder or from a specific plugin folder.

It has never been so easy before!
